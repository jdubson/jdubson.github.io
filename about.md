I'm a student at Metis Data Science Bootcamp in SF. I spent 3.5 years at Google working in spam analytics for Gmail and human computation for advertisements. Now I'm excited to transition to data science.

### Interests

Learning // Efficiency // Outdoor Adventures // Liverpool F.C. 

### Why Blog

As I embark on this journey into data science I want share lessons learned, difficulties encounters, trips & tricks, cool projects, etc. I hope that others will join me as I progress from knowing next to nothing and into a full-fledged data scientist.
